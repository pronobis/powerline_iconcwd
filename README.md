powerline_iconcwd
=================

A drop in replacement for the stock `cwd` segment in
[powerline](https://github.com/powerline/powerline), which allows for specifying
icons for paths/folders. To add an icon, simply create a hidden file
`.powerline_icon` at that location that should be represented by an icon,
containing the desired glyphs.
